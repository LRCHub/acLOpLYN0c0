[00:12.92] A squirrel in the tree, is he watching me?
[00:15.64] Does he give a damn? Does he care who I am?
[00:19.73] I'm just a man, is that all I am?
[00:22.11] Are my manners misinterpreted words or only human?
[00:25.70] I'm human
[00:30.20] 
[00:32.52] Murderous crow, hey, what you know?
[00:35.23] What you reading about? What you hold in your toes?
[00:39.18] Is that a twig? Are you a dove of peace?
[00:41.76] Black dove undercover with another puzzle piece
[01:05.26] 
[00:45.73] Are you a riddle to solve all along?
[00:48.03] Or am I overthinking thoughts? I'm human, afterall
[00:51.58] Only human, made of flesh, made of sand
[00:54.69] Made of human
[01:01.19] 
[00:58.71] The planet's talking about a revolution
[01:02.03] The natural laws ain't got no constitution
[01:04.57] They've got a right to live their own life
[01:07.56] But we keep paving over paradise
[01:23.56] 
[01:10.39] 'Cause we're only human
[01:13.22] Oh yes we are, only human
[01:20.08] If it's our only excuse
[01:21.48] Oh do we think we'll keep on being only human?
[01:26.26] Oh yes we are, only human
[01:33.43] So far, so far
[01:40.43] 
[01:50.64] Up in the major's tree
[01:52.24] The one he planted back when he was just a boy
[01:54.88] Back in 1923
[01:57.35] Thirty meters and a foot, take a look, take a climb
[02:00.60] What you'll find is the product of a seed
[02:21.10] 
[02:03.58] The seed is sown, all alone
[02:05.64] It grows above with a heart of love
[02:08.06] A sharpened shelter of the animals
[02:11.01] Of land and cold weather breathing
[02:14.07] We're all breathing
[02:16.59] The planet's talking about a revolution
[02:19.81] The natural laws ain't got no constitution
[02:22.38] They've got a right to live their own life
[02:25.40] But we keep paving over paradise
[02:41.40] 
[02:27.96] 'Cause we're only human
[02:31.14] Oh yes we are, only human
[02:37.66] If it's our only excuse
[02:39.17] Oh do we think we'll keep on being only human?
[02:44.28] Oh yes we are, only human
[02:51.45] So far, so far
[02:58.45] 
[02:54.78] And this place, it will outlive me
[02:58.18] Before I get to heaven I'll climb that tree
[03:01.59] And I will have to give my thanks
[03:04.83] For giving me the branch to swing on
[03:09.43] If I ever fall in love
[03:14.59] I'll hope to give myself a baby
[03:17.76] I will let my children have their way
[03:36.26] 
[03:21.43] Because we're only human
[03:24.68] Oh yes we are, only human
[03:31.82] So far, so far
[03:38.82] 
[03:44.87] So far, so far
